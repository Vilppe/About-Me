# About-Me
Who am I? What have I done? What am I doing? All things about me.

Hello!
Here are some projects in which I've taken part of.

	Aamusimulaattori:
	
		Aamusimulaattori is an open source game. I got the idea for this game during my military service.
		Aamusimulaattori is simulating the training of camping and survival skills.
		Many rookies consider being the most stressful times of the military service, both physically and mentally. That's why I thought that it would be a nice challenge to make it as an entertaining video game.
		We finished the project with two of my friends, Joa and Frans. We took our game to Assembly Summer 2017, the biggest LAN-party in Finland. Aamusimulaattori got 8th most votes in the competition.
