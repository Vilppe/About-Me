# About-Me
**Who am I? What have I done? What am I doing? All things about me.**

## Here are some game-developing projects I've been a part of.

### Aamusimulaattori:
	
	Aamusimulaattori is an open source game. I got the idea for this game during my military service.
	Aamusimulaattori is simulating the training of camping and survival skills.
	Many rookies consider being the most stressful times of the military service, both physically and mentally. That's why I thought that it would be a nice challenge to make it as an entertaining video game.
	We finished the project with two of my friends, Joa and Frans. We took our game to Assembly Summer 2017, the biggest LAN-party in Finland. Aamusimulaattori got 8th most votes in the competition.

## My Random projects:
	I've made some fun little minigames/apps with Unity3D. Most of the assets I've made myself with only a few exceptions. All of these are open source.

### "Siili" was made, because I wanted to try out the path-finding with agents and tilesets.
	(And because hedgehogs are cute, of course :3).

### "Swing" is my personal project.
		Because of a bug in Unity's path-finding itself, I abandoned this project for a while >:(. I think I'll finish it someday, hopefully, maybe, I hope...
		The gameplay mechanic is quite unique, I've not seen this type of controlling in any other game.
		I've planned to make this game available for several platforms, including the touch-input based ones.
